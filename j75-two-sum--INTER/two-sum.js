// Two Sum
// In this challenge, you need to write a function called twoSum(nums, target), which takes in two arguments: an array of integers nums and a target integer. The function has to find the indices of two numbers such that they add up to the target.

// You can assume that each input would have exactly one solution, integers in nums are unique and you may not use the same element twice.

// Directions
// You can assume that the input array nums will always have at least 2 integers.
// You can return the indices in any order.

const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
  // Write your code here
}

console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9))
// Output: [0,1]
twoSum([2, 7, 4, 15], 11) // Output: [1,2]
twoSum([2, 7, 13, 15], 28) // Output: [3,4]
